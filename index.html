  <h1>Trip's in my sister's neighborhood: Williamsburg</h1>

  <h3 id="orgin">Originally I live near Flatbush but once my sister moved her house became my third home. When I go to my sister's house these are the 3 places that you'd find us at!</h3>
  
  <h3>Domino Park</h3>
  <hr>
  <p id="Dominono">Domino Park is located in Williamsburg Brooklyn Ny along the East River at the former site of the Domino Sugar Refinery. When I go with my sister we bring our nieces and nephews and we go to the park. There's also this food place called Tacocina. They have super good cod fish tacos and churros.</p>

  <h3>Ruby's Cafe</h3>
  <hr>
  <p id="Rub">Rubys Cafe is one of my favorite cafes to eat at. The first time I had it I was in Manhattan but my sister found one in Williamsburg at 98 Berry St, Williamsburg, NY 11249. When I go to Rubys Cafe I usually order a burger with fries and spicy italian sausage pasta. I also get a butterfly lavender lemondae or strawberry lemondae.</p>

  <h3>Chip city</h3>
  <hr>
  <p id="chip">Chip City I'd say is better than Crumble cookie. The cookies taste better and the quality in my opinion is also better. The one I go to is the one on 123 Kent Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11249. Their kind of like crumble mainly because the cookies changes often but then their not that crumble because they offer more cookies then crumble.</p>
